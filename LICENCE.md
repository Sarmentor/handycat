You acknowledge that the Software may not be free of errors or bugs. DCU has no obligation to support or update the Software in any way.

Limitation of Liability 
You acknowledge that the Software has not been developed to meet your individual requirements and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software meet your requirements.

Other Important Terms
We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Licence.

You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Licence to another person if you obtain our prior consent in writing to do so. 
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the us which is not set out in this Licence.
If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.
This Licence, its subject matter and its formation, are governed by Irish law. You and we both agree to that the courts of Ireland will have exclusive jurisdiction.
